                <p>Softwood is usually wood from gymnosperm trees such as pines and spruces. Softwoods are not
                    necessarily
                    softer than hardwoods.[1]In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, the
                    range of density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods. Some hardwoods (e.g. balsa)
                    are
                    softer than most softwoods, while the hardest hardwoods are much harder than softwood.These woods of
                    long leafpine Douglas , and are much more harder in the mechanical sense than several hardwoods.</p>
